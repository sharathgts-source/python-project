Project Title: Smart Resume Parser

The Smart Resume Parser is an intelligent system designed to automatically extract and structure key information from resumes (in PDF or DOCX formats). It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Python technologies to identify and categorize details such as personal information, skills, education, experience, and projects — converting unstructured text into a structured, machine-readable format (like JSON or tables).

Traditional hiring processes involve manually scanning through hundreds of resumes, which is both time-consuming and error-prone. The Smart Resume Parser automates this process, helping recruiters, HR departments, and job portals quickly shortlist candidates based on their qualifications and skills

Objective :
To build a Python-based tool that:

Extracts text from PDF or Word (DOCX) resumes.

Processes and cleans the extracted text.

Uses spaCy NLP and regular expressions to identify sections such as:

Candidate name and contact details

Educational qualifications

Work experience

Skills and certifications

Projects and achievements

Displays structured results in a user-friendly Streamlit web interface.

 Technologies Used
Category	Tools & Libraries

NLP Processing	spaCy
Data Handling	re (Regular Expressions), pandas
Frontend	Streamlit
File Formats	PDF, DOCX
 System Architecture

Input Module

Uploads resume files (.pdf or .docx).

Text Extraction Module

Uses PyMuPDF (for PDF) or docx (for Word) to extract raw text.

Text Preprocessing

Removes unwanted characters, punctuation, and extra whitespace.

Information Extraction Module

Applies spaCy Named Entity Recognition (NER) and regex patterns to identify:

Name, Email, Phone

Skills

Education details (degree, institution, year)

Experience (company names, roles, duration)

Data Structuring Module

Converts extracted information into a JSON-like structured output.

Frontend Display (Streamlit)

User-friendly dashboard to:

Upload resume

View parsed results

Export structured data (CSV/JSON)

 Key Features

- Supports multiple resume formats (PDF, DOCX)
- Automatically identifies key sections using NLP
- Extracts skills and experience duration
- User-friendly Streamlit interface
- Option to download parsed data in structured form
- Easy integration with HR or ATS systems

 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

User uploads a resume file via the Streamlit app.

The backend extracts text using PyMuPDF or docx.

Text is cleaned and passed to spaCy NLP pipeline.

Custom rules (regex + entity recognition) extract relevant sections.

Parsed data is displayed in a structured form (table or JSON).

 Applications

Recruitment Automation — HR systems can quickly shortlist candidates.

Job Portals — Automatically populate candidate profiles.

Educational Institutions — Analyze students’ resumes for placement readiness.

Data Analytics — Build dashboards of skill distributions, experience levels, etc.

 Future Enhancements

Add AI-based classification of resumes (e.g., by job role).

Support for multiple languages.

Integration with databases and ATS systems.

Add machine learning models to predict candidate-job fit.

Generate visual analytics of parsed data.
